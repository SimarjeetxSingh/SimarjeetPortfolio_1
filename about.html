             <li>A tech enthusiast and a creative soul on a mission to make the world a better place through technology, faith, and the rhythm of life. As a B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student at Giani Zail Singh Campus College of Engineering and Technology, Bathinda, I've been honing my technical skills and cultivating a profound understanding of the intricacies of computer science.</li>
             <li>My journey has been an exciting blend of spirituality, creativity, and academic pursuits. With a strong belief in the divine and a love for coding and dance, I've discovered that pursuing my passions brings immense happiness and fulfilment.</li>
             <li>Throughout my academic journey, I've eagerly taken on challenges, consistently striving for excellence in both theoretical knowledge and practical application. I believe that creativity and logic go hand in hand with problem-solving and innovation.</li>
             <li>Beyond the realms of technology, I find solace on the volleyball court, where friendly competition and teamwork teach me valuable life lessons about discipline, collaboration, and striving for success as a team. Dancing, especially the vibrant art form of Bhangra, connects me with my culture and provides an outlet for expressing my emotions.</li>
             <li>My vision is to utilize my coding skills to contribute to innovative projects that positively impact the world. With an unwavering belief in God, I approach life with humility, empathy, and gratitude, cherishing the opportunities that come my way.</li>
             <li>I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals and potential collaborators as I embark on this exciting journey. Let's make the world a better place, one line of code and one Bhangra step at a time together. As I continue to tread the path of education and self-discovery, I am open to exploring new opportunities and challenges in the tech industry, where I can apply my skills and passion to create meaningful innovations.</li>
